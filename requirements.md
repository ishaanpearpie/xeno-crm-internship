# Xeno SDE Internship Assignment â€“ 2025

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

Thanks for applying to the SDE Internship position at Xeno. Weâ€™re excited to get to know you through this hands-on assignment that reflects the kind of real-world challenges we solve every day.  

---

## ðŸš€ Assignment Goal

Build a **Mini CRM Platform** that enables customer segmentation, personalized campaign delivery, and intelligent insights using modern tools and approaches.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Scope of Work

### âœ… 1. Data Ingestion APIs
- Create secure, well-documented REST APIs to ingest customers and orders data.  
- Use Postman or Swagger UI to demonstrate API usage.  
- **Brownie Points**: Implement a pub-sub architecture using a message broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, etc.) where:  
  - API layer handles only validation.  
  - Actual data persistence happens asynchronously via a consumer service.  

---

### âœ… 2. Campaign Creation UI
Build a simple web application that lets a user:  
- Define audience segments using flexible rule logic (e.g., `spend > INR 10,000 AND visits < 3 OR inactive for 90 days`).  
- Combine conditions using AND/OR with a dynamic rule builder.  
- Preview audience size before saving the segment.  
- After saving, redirect to a campaign history page showing:  
  - List of past campaigns.  
  - Delivery stats (sent, failed, audience size).  
  - Most recent campaign at the top.  

**Bonus**: Implement a clean, intuitive UX (drag-and-drop, visual rule blocks, or other creative approaches).  

---

### âœ… 3. Campaign Delivery & Logging
- On saving a segment, initiate a new campaign:  
  - Store campaign details in a `communication_log` table.  
  - Send a personalized message to each customer via a dummy vendor API.  
    - Example: `"Hi Mohit, hereâ€™s 10% off on your next order!"`  
  - The Vendor API should simulate delivery success/failure (~90% SENT, ~10% FAILED).  
  - Vendor API must hit a **Delivery Receipt API** on your backend.  
- The Delivery Receipt API should:  
  - Update the delivery status in the communication log.  
  - **Brownie Points**: Use a consumer-driven process that updates DB in batches, even if API hits are individual.  

---

### âœ… 4. Authentication
- Implement Google OAuth 2.0-based authentication.  
- Ensure that only logged-in users can create audiences or view campaigns.  

---

### âœ… 5. AI Integration
Incorporate at least one AI-powered feature into your CRM app. This is an opportunity to showcase creativity and practical use of modern tools.  

#### ðŸ§  Suggested AI Use Cases
1. **Natural Language to Segment Rules**  
   - Allow users to write prompts like *"People who havenâ€™t shopped in 6 months and spent over â‚¹5K"* and convert them into logical rules.  

2. **AI-Driven Message Suggestions**  
   - Given a campaign objective (e.g., *"bring back inactive users"*), generate 2â€“3 message variants to choose from.  
   - **Bonus**: Recommend relevant product or offer images based on message tone or audience.  

3. **Campaign Performance Summarization**  
   - Instead of just showing sent/failed stats, generate a human-readable insight summary:  
     > "Your campaign reached 1,284 users. 1,140 messages were delivered. Customers with > â‚¹10K spend had a 95% delivery rate."  

4. **Smart Scheduling Suggestions**  
   - Recommend the best time/day to send a campaign based on customer activity patterns (mock or simulate logic).  

5. **Audience Lookalike Generator**  
   - Suggest additional audiences based on the characteristics of high-performing segments (e.g., people similar to those who responded last time).  

6. **Auto-tagging Campaigns**  
   - Use AI to label campaigns (e.g., "Win-back", "High Value Customers") based on audience and message intent.  

**Note**: Use any public AI APIs (OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, Replicate, etc.) or local models. Just clearly document what you used and why.  

---

## ðŸ›  Preferred Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js or Next.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js or Java (Spring Boot)  
- **Database**: MySQL or MongoDB  
- **Optional**: Kafka / RabbitMQ / Redis Streams for pub-sub  
- **Optional**: AI tools, LLM APIs, image APIs for personalization  

---

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Criteria
Weâ€™ll be assessing:  
- Code quality and project structure.  
- Creative problem solving and clean UX.  
- Scalability (especially in ingestion & delivery flows).  
- AI integration and thoughtful use of tools.  
- Completeness of your solution (demo, README, hosting).  
- Communication skills in your demo video.  

**Note**: Plagiarism is a strict no-go. All work must be your own. You will be asked questions based on your implementation.  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Submission Requirements
- âœ… Public GitHub repo with well-organized code.  
- âœ… Deployed project (Render, Vercel, Railway, etc.).  
- âœ… Demo video (max 7 mins) in your own voice explaining:  
  - Features.  
  - How you approached the problem.  
  - Any trade-offs made.  
  - AI features added.  
- âœ… README.md with:  
  - Local setup instructions.  
  - Architecture diagram.  
  - Summary of AI tools and other tech used.  
  - Known limitations or assumptions.
